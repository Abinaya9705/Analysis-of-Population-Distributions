# Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis of Population Distributions
Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing the distribution of population data. It uses Python to generate statistical insights and create various visualizations such as histograms and bar charts. The project aims to provide a clear understanding of continuous variables (e.g., age) and categorical variables (e.g., gender). Additionally, it demonstrates techniques for comparing distributions and enhancing visual storytelling with interactive tools.
Features:
Histogram Visualization: Displays the distribution of continuous variables like age.
Bar Chart Visualization: Represents the frequency of categorical variables like gender.
Overlapping Histograms: Compares distributions across different groups, e.g., age by gender.
Summary Statistics: Provides descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for each group.
Interactive Visualizations: Uses Plotly for dynamic exploration of data.
Dashboard Integration: Builds an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.
Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.
Libraries:
numpy for data simulation and manipulation.
matplotlib for static visualizations.
pandas for data handling and summary statistics.
plotly for interactive visualizations.
streamlit for creating a web-based dashboard.
